# agile-final-project
Final Project for the Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum offered by IBM on Coursera


### Your team has been tasked with developing the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. Stakeholders require the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete products from the catalog, along with features like indicating product likes and hosting on a cloud environment with automated deployments. 
### Your team will use a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the product owner, you will drive the process by leveraging the skills learned in the lessons and labs to create a new GitHub repository and kanban board and fill the kanban board with issues that will become user stories.
